This prototype allows for sensor data to be shared with and interpreted by actuators. In our prototype the data is read from a text file which has a specific structure to make the extraction of information easier. 
The code is divided into two main parts. The first part creates a class for a desired object (Simulation.java)
a scanner object (scanner.java) or an actuator object (actuator.java). Once these are created in the second part, the values, which are read from the file RuleImput.txt, are attributed to the corresponding actuator.
